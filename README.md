# Triaume - An augmented triangle
### by  Marcio Albano Hermelino Ferreira

### Introduction

In this project, we used capacitive sensing techniques to test new
musical gesture possibilities for an triangle - an old instrument 
that is widely used on Brazilian traditional music.

Our goal is the development of  a non-invaisve instrument augmenting approach,
that could retain the triangle acoustic sounds, but giving additional functionalities to it through digital sound synthesis



### Resources

On its most recent version, the following materials were used:

- ESP32 board

- 1MOhm resistor.

- Alligator clips and jumper cables.

- Insultaging tape

- Copper adhesive tape
